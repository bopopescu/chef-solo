SSL Termination on your load balancer with pound.

1. Override the HAProxy template to have 2 HTTP listeners instead of one port 80 HTTP and one port 443 TCP
   e.g. port 80 HTTP and 81 HTTP
2. Add the `pound` recipe to the lb on setup
3. Either paste your SSL cert in the ssl.pem.erb template of pound or put it in custom JSON and read it there

At the end pound will listen on port 443, will do the SSL termination and then forward to localhost:81 which is HAProxy.
HAProxy will forward/load-balance as usual to your application servers.
